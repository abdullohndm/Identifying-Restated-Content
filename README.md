This repository describes classification of paraphrases and research on identifying sentential paraphrases.

## Classification of Paraphrases
Paraphrases can be classified based on their granularity and style.

Granularity includes surface, structural, and discourse level paraphrases. 
Style includes trivial changes, phrase/sentence replacement/reordering, split/merge, and complex paraphrases.

## Applications of Paraphrase Identification
Identifying paraphrases can benefit applications like machine translation, question answering, information extraction/retrieval, summarization, natural language generation, and identifying plagiarism.

## Relevant Research Topic
Related areas include textual entailment and semantic textual similarity.

## Research on Paraphrasing
Main areas are paraphrase identification, extraction, generation, and applications.
  
## Paraphrase Identification
Specifically refers to identifying whether two given sentences are paraphrases of each other.

## Identification Methods
Previous works treat it as a classification problem using similarities at different levels as features. Other works align sentences and score based on alignments.
More details on past research are in the state-of-art document.
